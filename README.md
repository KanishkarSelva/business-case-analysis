SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `ecom.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE table_name = 'customers'
```

### Screenshot

### Insights
- The query reveals the data structure of the customers table, highlighting that it comprises columns with data types of both String and Int64. Understanding the data types is crucial for data integrity and query optimization. For instance, knowing that customer_id is an Int64 assures us it can handle large numeric values efficiently, while customer_name being a String indicates it's designed to store textual data, which is essential for personalization and identification.

### Recommendations
- Data Type Consistency: Ensure consistency in the data types used across the database to prevent type mismatch errors. For instance, if customer_id references another table, both should be of type Int64.
- Query Optimization: Use the knowledge of data types to optimize queries. Knowing a column is an Int64 allows for numerical operations and optimizations, while String operations might require different indexing strategies.
- Data Validation: Implement robust data validation rules, especially for String fields, to maintain data quality. For example, setting maximum lengths on String fields can help avoid data truncation errors.

### Insights
- This query provides a geographical breakdown of the customer base, revealing significant concentrations in specific cities and states. The data indicates that customers from "Sao Paulo" city, in "Sao Paulo" state, have the highest number of orders, significantly outpacing other regions. This suggests a strong market presence in Sao Paulo, potentially due to its large population and economic status. The disparity between "Sao Paulo" and other cities like "Rio de Janeiro" underscores varying market penetrations across different regions.

### Recommendations
- Market Focus: Given the high concentration of customers in "Sao Paulo", it may be beneficial to focus marketing and sales efforts in this area to further capitalize on the existing customer base. This could include localized advertising campaigns, opening new stores, or enhancing delivery logistics for faster service.
- Expansion Opportunities: While "Sao Paulo" shows strong sales, there's potential for growth in other cities and states with fewer customers. Identifying reasons for lower penetration in these areas—be it lack of awareness, preference for competitors, or logistical challenges—can guide strategic expansions.
- Localized Offerings: Tailor product offerings and marketing messages to the specific preferences and needs of customers in top cities and states. For regions with emerging customer bases, conduct market research to understand local preferences and customize offerings accordingly.
- Infrastructure Investments: For areas with significant customer activity, consider investing in infrastructure, such as warehouses or distribution centers, to improve delivery times and reduce shipping costs.

## Q2.1: Is There a Growing Trend in the No. of Orders Placed Over the Past Years?

### Query

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) AS order_year, 
  COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
FROM `ecom.orders`
GROUP BY order_year
ORDER BY order_year

### Screenshot

![](images/Aspose.Words.f392bb6f-7625-4882-87a6-4dc91ee39796.004.png)


### Insights

From this above image we can understand that the number of order placed over past years is increased.

- The reason of low total orders in 2016 is because the data is available only for September and October month. This might be less data acquired.

- The results indicate a substantial growth in the number of orders placed over the past years:

- In 2016, there were 329 orders, which can be considered a starting or pilot phase.

- In 2017, the number of orders increased dramatically to 45,101. This represents an increase of more than 100 times the previous year, signaling a significant uptake in the company's market presence or consumer adoption of the service.

- In 2018, the growth continued, with the total orders reaching 54,011. This is an increase of approximately 20% from 2017.


### Recommendations

- Investigate Underlying Factors: Analyze the factors contributing to this growth. This could include marketing campaigns, expansion into new markets, improvements to the online platform, or broader economic factors.

- Sustain Growth: Identify the successful strategies that have driven this growth and consider how to sustain or enhance them. This might include scaling up marketing, improving logistics and supply chain management, or expanding product ranges.

- Infrastructure Scalability: Ensure that the company's infrastructure, both technical and logistical, can handle further increases in order volume. It's essential to scale operations to avoid potential bottlenecks as the company grows.

- Customer Experience Focus: With the increase in order volume, maintain a focus on customer service quality. Growth should not come at the expense of customer satisfaction.

## Q2.2: Can We See Some Kind of Monthly Seasonality in Terms of the No. of Orders Being Placed?

### Query

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) AS order_year, 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_purchase_timestamp) AS order_month, 
  COUNT(order_id) AS monthly_orders
FROM `ecom.orders`
GROUP BY order_year, order_month
ORDER BY order_year, order_month

```
 ### Screenshot

![](images/Aspose.Words.f392bb6f-7625-4882-87a6-4dc91ee39796.005.png)


### Insights:

- Initial Growth: Starting with just a few orders in September 2016, there is a rapid increase in the number of orders placed, reaching a peak in November 2017 with 7544 orders. This growth could be associated with an increased market presence, marketing campaigns, seasonal sales, or expanding product lines.

- Year-End Peak: There is a notable peak towards the end of each year, especially in November and December, which could be attributed to holiday shopping for events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas.

- Start of the Year Momentum: The momentum continues into the new year, with January 2018 also showing a high number of orders. This may reflect New Year promotions or gift card redemptions following the holiday season.

- Mid-Year Plateau: From February to August, the monthly orders seem to stabilize with a slight uptrend in 2018 compared to the corresponding months in 2017, suggesting steady demand and possibly effective customer retention strategies.

- Sharp Drop:  There is a significant drop in September 2018, which deviates from the previous trend and continues to remain very low into October 2018. This is an anomaly that needs to be investigated.

### Recommendation:

- Investigate Anomalies: Look into the sharp decline in orders in September and October 2018 to understand whether it was due to external factors, operational issues, changes in consumer behavior, or data recording errors.

- Capitalize on Peak Seasons: Strengthen inventory and marketing strategies around the November-December period to maximize sales during the peak shopping season.

- Engagement During Off-Peak Months: Develop promotions and marketing initiatives to boost orders during traditionally lower-performing months, from February to August.

- Customer Behavior Analysis: Conduct customer surveys or market research to understand the factors driving seasonality, which may include looking at economic trends, competitor activity, and changing consumer preferences.

- Long-Term Data Tracking: Continue to collect and analyze data beyond October 2018 to confirm these seasonal trends and adjust strategies accordingly.

SELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 0 AND 6 THEN 'Dawn'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 7 AND 12 THEN 'Morning'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 13 AND 18 THEN 'Afternoon'
    WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) BETWEEN 19 AND 23 THEN 'Night'

```

### Screenshot

![](images/Aspose.Words.f392bb6f-7625-4882-87a6-4dc91ee39796.006.png)


### Insights

The query delineates customer order patterns across different times of the day, revealing:

- A predominant preference for placing orders in the **Afternoon** (13-18 hrs), followed by **Night** (19-23 hrs), which indicates that customers are more inclined to shop online later in the day.
- **Morning** (7-12 hrs) also sees a significant number of orders, suggesting that a notable portion of customers prefers to shop after the start of their day.
- The least amount of activity occurs during **Dawn** (0-6 hrs), which is expected as this is typically when most individuals are asleep or not active online.

### Recommendations

- **Afternoon and Night Promotions**: Given the high activity during these times, consider running flash sales or special promotions to capture the attention of customers already online.
  
- **Enhance Customer Support**: Ensure that customer support is more readily available during peak shopping hours to assist with any inquiries or issues, enhancing the shopping experience.
  
- **Morning Engagement**: For the morning shoppers, targeted marketing emails or notifications could be sent out early in the day to capture their interest and encourage purchases.
  
- **Optimize for Mobile Shopping**: With a significant amount of shopping occurring in the afternoon and evening, ensure the mobile shopping experience is seamless, as customers might be using their phones to shop during these times.
  
- **Experiment with Dawn Offers**: Though it's the least active time, experimenting with early bird specials might capture a niche market of early risers or those looking to make purchases before their day starts.
